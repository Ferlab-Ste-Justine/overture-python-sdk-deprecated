# About

SDK to abstract away call details to all the services a client needs to talk to in order to perform operations on an overture stack.

Its only used in the clin overture client currently: https://github.com/cr-ste-justine/clin-overture-client

It is a work in progress (not all endpoints on overture services are implemented in the client, only those projets that use the library depend on) and the project still has legacy parts (located in **song/original_song**) that are being phased out from the out of date Python client in the upstream SONG repo.
